DAO Awards are an opportunity for recognition of the teams building DAOs and a way for us to raise the awareness of DAOs among general public. This will, we hope, help DAOs get more users, and attract new talents to try and build their very first DAOs. Join us for this amazing event on April 25th in Split, Croatia!

We have invite **everybody** to help us make Awards what they should be!

We are looking for your help:
1. Nominate candidates
2. Contribute to DAO awards rulebook
3. Help organize
4. Sponsor the awards

Also, among other things, we need your help to define the rules, including:
  - eligibility criteria (what is DAO),
  - award criteria (how do we compare DAOs),
  - award categories,
  - and more.

  Please use #daoawards and #daocon when talking about DAO Awards, so we can find you comments and suggestions and incorporate them in our plans!
