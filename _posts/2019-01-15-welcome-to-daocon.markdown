# Why?
As Ethereum infrastructure slowly getting functional and easy to use we see more and more people starting to use it to run their businesses on it. This, in turn, creates a motivation for developers to build tools and services specialized for these businesses.

We hope to see and aid the growth of the industry by helping entrepreneurs start and grow their Ethereum based businesses, as well as helping developers find users and partners for their services.

# How?
As this nascent industry is growing, we are determined to bring together the pioneers in one place to meet and interact. Being able to show your work to live audience and talking directly to your users/service providers has an invaluable benefit.
