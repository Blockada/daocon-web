As Ethereum infrastructure slowly getting functional and easy to use we see more and more people starting to use it to run their businesses on it. This, in turn, creates a motivation for developers to build tools and services specialized for these businesses. Most extreme type of these businesses are joining other organizations in becoming Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - DAOs.

### Why?
We hope to see and aid the growth of the industry by helping entrepreneurs start and grow their Ethereum based businesses and hopefully turn them into DAOs, as well as helping developers find users and partners for their services.

### How?
As this nascent industry is growing, we are determined to bring together the pioneers in one place to meet and interact. Being able to show your work to live audience and talking directly to your users/service providers has an invaluable benefit.

### What?
**DaoCon. One-day show and bazaar.**  
Here you can present your solution, find a solution, pitch your idea, network and sell your services directly to DAOs and other Ethereum based entrepreneurs.

**Date:** April 27th 2019.  
**Location:** Split, Croatia  
**Venue:** Faculty of Economics, Cvite Fiskovića 5, 21000 Split
