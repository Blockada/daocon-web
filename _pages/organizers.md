DaoCon is organized by **[Blockada](https://blockada.io)**.

Blockada is a NGO founded in July 2018 to help grow blockchain community in South-East Europe. Our main activities are BlockSplit, Bločk and DaoCon. But we also help organize Ethereum Magicians Council of Paris.

## Bločk
BLOČK is a blockchain developer conference that takes place in December in town of Čakovec in north Croatia. With 90 attendees and a group of internationally acclaimed speakers, we aim to establish a transfer of high-quality theoretical and practical knowledge through talks and workshops, and to inspire a fruitful exchange of new ideas, concepts, and good vibes during informal parts of the conference that will include a town-wide cryptohunt and a crypto party on Saturday night.

## BlockSplit
BlockSplit is a conference for blockchain developers and businesses. Its aim is to help grow the global blockchain ecosystem. BlockSplit is an opportunity for developers and founders of next big blockchain projects to learn and meet. Active blockchain projects will be able to invest in growing their own respective communities by helping new members of the community in starting their own journey in this exciting industry. The conference is tailored for programmers and project managers looking at the potential of working with the blockchain technology.
