### Exhibition
An open space will be set up for DaoCon0 participants to exhibit their projects and services. If you are interested in presenting your DAO or a service, please fill in this [form](https://denther.typeform.com/to/WY6GsX).

Exhibition will take place after all the talks and will last for two hours: from 15:30 until 17:30. We will provide you with a chair and a shared table with electricity and internet.

### Lightning talks
One room will be designated for lightning talks, 5 minutes short presentations of projects and ideas followed by 5 minutes of questions and answers by audience. Here you can present what you are working on, or a new idea you had. It has to be a DAO or related to DAOs.  

Good thing about lightning talks is that they don't require as much preparation as full talks or workshops. On other hand, you get a video recording of presentation which you can use to pitch project to your partners and users.

If you want to give a lightning talk, please fill in this [form](https://denther.typeform.com/to/WY6GsX).

### Workshops

### Solution show

- Finances for DAOs
- Administration tools for DAOs
- Payments for DAOs
- Marketing tools for DAOs
- Communication tools for DAOs
- Human resources tools for DAOs
